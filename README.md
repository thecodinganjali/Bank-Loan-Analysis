Welcome to the Bank Loan Report Dashboard! This project focuses on analyzing key loan metrics using Microsoft Excel to provide insights into our bank's lending activities. By transforming raw loan data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations, we aim to make data-driven decisions, track loan portfolio health, and identify trends for better lending strategies.
